# Contribution Templates

The contribution templates and guidelines used for projects at ACM @ UCSD.

## Contents

This repository provides a standard for the following:
- Issue/PR templates
- Code of Conduct
- Contribution Guidelines
- Example labels

## Issue/PR Templates

The templates for issue and PR's cover features and bugs. These are currently
written for projects in web development, but should ACM create other kinds of
projects more frequently, templates for those will be added here as well.

## Code of Conduct

ACM uses the Contributor Covenant as a Code of Conduct for all discussions and comments
within the repositories.

## Contribution Guidelines

These guidelines cover how members should contribute to repositories in ACM. There
are multiple guidelines for each kind of project.

## Example Labels

Each project should have a set of labels to easily filter issues and PR's when necessary.
There are multiple example lists for each kind of project.

## You want to contribute to the contribution guidelines?

A bit too much meta going on here, but if you would like to add more templates yourself
or suggest a set to be written up, [file an issue](https://github.com/acmucsd/contribution-templates/issues/new/choose)
or fork and set up a PR.
