# Contributing

We'd love any contribution from you to our project! Any initiative shown by our members is a testament
to our tight-knit community. In order to ensure the best contribution experience for everyone else,
you should follow these guidelines.

## Getting Started

You can contribute in a number of ways to this project. Primarily, there are two different kinds of
contributions:

- Issue creation
- Code

We'll cover each of the two and how to best approach them.

## Issues

Issues in our projects are kind of like conversations; when we find a problem
or a new idea that should be discussed, we generally open an issue. The Dev
Team not only frequently checks new issues to flesh out details of feature
requests, but also directly works along with the conversation to allow for easy
contribution from other members.

If you want to file an issue, there are two templates:

- Feature/Enhancement Request
- Bug Report

It's recommended you stick to the templates, as it allows the Dev Team to
process issues quicker.  However, before submitting a new issue, make sure
there isn't a duplicate already on the issues tracker.  Search for your issue
and add a "thumbs-up" emote to the issue if you find one that covers your
concern.  If it doesn't perfectly cover it, make sure to join the conversation
and see whether other members share your concern.

When submitting new issues, be sure to:

- Be clear and concise
  - The better you can describe what the bug or feature is, the faster we'll be able to work on it.
- Provide as much information before-hand as possible.
  - Sometimes, the Dev Team (and perhaps other members) will ask for clarification on your bug or
    feature if you're not too in-depth. Make sure to provide as much material to help out with
    the issue.
- Leave labels empty
  - The Dev Team will handle the labels for you. We use them for internal tracking of tasks as well,
    so it's best left as is.

## Code

So you like coding and want to get into it. That's great! For starters, it's best to run
through this checklist so you can get started fast with coding:

- [ ] Fork this repo. If you're not a member of the Dev Team, you won't be able to write code otherwise
- [ ] Check the README. It contains build instructions, how to setup dev tooling, the philosophy behind the project, and so on.
- [ ] Skim the file structure. Check how React components are split, where the reducers are places, where static assets are stored, etc.

Afterwards, you can get started with coding. Here are some tips to get your
code accepted the fastest.

- Use Git properly
  - Make sure to branch off of the `nightly` branch
  - Make commits often and atomic ("Start early, start often")
  - Use imperative clauses for Git commit messages ("Add new feature", "Fix old bug", etc.)
  - Make sure your commit messages are well-written and contain useful information
- Use the tooling of the project
  - Make sure to lint your project before committing
  - Write unit tests! We know it's hard (we're guilty of avoiding this) but it helps so much in the future
  - Use any internal custom tooling if it's included instead of another alternative. If you'd like to suggest
    an alternative to the internal tooling, file an issue to spark up some conversation about it.

After you're done implementing the issue, make sure to open a PR for your fork
using the provided template.

### PR's

After you're done with the code, all to do now is ask for a code review. If you
don't who to specifically ping for a review, you can ping the Frontend Team in
order to make sure someone will pick up your PR. After that, a member of the
Dev Team will review your code and provide you with feedback on it.

A Dev Team member might request changes to your PR. If that's the case, make
sure to fix them before re-requesting a review. Do make sure to request a
review from the same Dev Team member, however.

Whenever conversations spark with regards to code implementation, make sure to
talk them out in the code review comments. That way, the driving thoughts
behind changes are kept for later.

If your PR gets accepted, congrats! You've added code to the project! Make sure
to "Squash and Merge" when you're done.

## Dev Team

The Dev Team is very eager to help you contribute to the project. Not only
that, but they are committed to coding a significant amount for the project on
a weekly basis. Therefore, the Dev Team has some particular niches with regards
to working on a project.

### "Accepted" Label

When an issue gets picked up by the Dev Team to work on, it will have the
"Accepted" label attached to it. This means the Dev Team is very likely to work
on this issue soon. Therefore, considering their commitment, it's best to look
for another issue to work on if the Dev Team has "accepted" an issue into their
pipeline. If, however, you would still like to help a Dev Team member with
their issue, make sure to DM the assignee of the issue on Discord. This way,
they can onboard you if they need the help and pitch you in on what they've
been working on.

### Draft PR's

For any feature the Dev Team is actively working on, a draft PR will be opened
on the original repository. Think of this as a list of features the Dev Team is
currently working on. The "roadmap" of the project will always be the most up
to date here.

### Wiki

The Dev Team is responsible for adding new documentation to the wiki of the project.
However, it is best for you to write your own wiki entries and attach them to the PR
you're working on. The Dev Team will also review your wiki entries and add them to the
wiki if your PR gets merged.
