# Contributing

If you would like to add more potential contribution guidelines for other kinds of
projects at ACM, you can propose to add them here.

## You can branch off!

It's important to note that you don't have to follow the templates provided in this
repository to a T. You can customize the templates you find here to fit your usecases.
It is up to you if you would like to add them to this repository, but you don't have to.

For instance, if this repository does not contain issue templates for embedded programming
projects, that's fine; just create your own. You can choose to add them here as well, at a later time.

However, we mandate the same [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/acmucsd/contribution-templates/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
as this repository for all projects under ACM.

## How do I add new templates?

There are three main folders in this repository:
- `GUIDELINES`
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATES`
- `PR_TEMPLATES`

Each one contains subfolders with the kind of project that might find use
for each of the templates. For example, issues and PR templates for webdev
projects can be found under the "web" subfolder.

Whenever adding new templates for a new category of project, simply add them
as subfolders for each of the above main folders. That way, they can be easily copied to a new
project using `deploy_templates.sh`

If you have access, branch off when creating new sets of templates. Otherwise, fork this repository
and branch out. When you're done, submit a PR to allow for the Dev Team to review the new templates.
